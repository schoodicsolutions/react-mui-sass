# React-MUI-SASS Package: A Comprehensive React, Vite, and TypeScript Setup

The React-MUI-SASS package provides a sophisticated setup for React projects, incorporating React Router, MUI, SASS, React Query, TypeScript, and Vite. This setup is complemented by enhanced ESLint and Prettier configurations and TypeScript type aliases, ensuring a robust development environment.

## Key Technologies

- **React**: For building dynamic user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **MUI (Material-UI)**: A React UI framework for faster, easier web development.
- **SASS**: A CSS preprocessor for writing maintainable, extendable styles.
- **React Query**: A powerful tool for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in React.
- **TypeScript**: Adding type safety and enhanced developer experience to JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A modern, fast frontend build tool with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## ESLint Configuration Highlights

The ESLint configuration extends from popular standards like Airbnb and includes rules specific to React and TypeScript. It ensures code quality and consistency across the project.

## Prettier Configuration Highlights

Prettier is configured to work seamlessly with ESLint, enforcing a consistent code style throughout the project.

## TypeScript Configuration Highlights

The TypeScript configuration includes default path aliases to make development a breeze.

```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["src/*"],
  "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
  "@assets/*": ["src/assets/*"],
  "@constants/*": ["src/constants/*"]
}
```

## Vite Integration

This package leverages Vite's efficient build tooling to offer a fast development experience with features like:

- Fast Refresh using [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) with Babel or SWC.
- Customizable ESLint and Prettier setups to maintain code standards.
- TypeScript support for type safety and enhanced developer experience.

## Additional ESLint and Prettier Rules

The package includes additional ESLint and Prettier rules to further enhance code quality and consistency, aligning with the latest best practices in web development.

By integrating these technologies and configurations, the React-MUI-SASS package offers a comprehensive, efficient, and modern environment for developing React applications.
